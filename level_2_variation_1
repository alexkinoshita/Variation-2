A man walks down the street He says why am I soft in the middle now<br>
Why am I soft in the middle The rest of my life is so hard<br>
I need a photo-opportunity I want a shot at redemption<br>
Don't want to end up a cartoonIn a cartoon graveyard<br>
Bonedigger BonediggerDogs in the moonlight<br>
Far away my well-lit door<br>
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly<br>
Get these mutts <br>
away from me<br>
<strong>You know<br>
I don't<br>
find this<br>
stuff amusing anymore<br></strong>
If you'll be my bodyguard I can be <br>
your long lost pal I can call you Betty<br>
And Betty when you call me You can call me Al<br>
A man walks down the street He says why am I short of attention<br>
Got a short little span of attentionAnd wo my nights are so <br>
long Where's my wife and family What if I die here <br>
Who'll be my role-model Now that my role-model is<br>
Gone Gone He ducked back down the alley <br>
With some roly-poly little bat-faced <br>
girl All along along There were <br>
incidents and accidents<br>
There were <br>
hints and <br>
allegations<br>
<strong>If you'll be my bodyguard<br>
I can be your long lost pal I can <br>
call you Betty And Betty when <br>
you call me You can call <br>
me Al Call me Al<br></strong>
A man walks <br>
down <br>
the street<br>
It's a street in <br>
a strange world Maybe it's <br>
the Third World Maybe it's his<br>
first time aroundHe doesn't speak the language<br>
He holds no currency He is a foreign man He is surrounded <br>
by the sound The sound Cattle in the marketplace<br>
Scatterlings and orphanages<br>
He looks around, around<br>
He sees angels <br>
in the architecture<br>
Spinning in infinity<br>
He says Amen! and Hallelujah!<br>
If you'll be my bodyguard<br>
I can be your long lost <br>
palI can call you Betty<br>
And Betty when <br>
you call me<br>
You can call <br>
me Al<br>
Call <br>
me <br>
Al<br>
